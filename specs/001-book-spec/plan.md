**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus (for book platform), ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity Engine, NVIDIA Isaac SDK.
**Storage**: Content stored as Markdown/MDX files within the Docusaurus project structure.
**Testing**: Verification of code examples for functionality and expected output. Technical and editorial review of all written content.
**Target Platform**: Web (generated by Docusaurus), Linux (for ROS 2, Gazebo, Isaac development), Windows/macOS (for Unity development).
**Project Type**: Documentation (Docusaurus-based technical book).
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading Docusaurus site; efficient, clear, and runnable code examples; high clarity of explanations (as per Constitution Principle IV).
**Constraints**: Adherence to "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution" principles (Content Accuracy, Structured Learning, Practical Application, Tone & Style, Chapter Format, Focus Areas Integration). Must deliver between 10-14 chapters.
**Scale/Scope**: 11 chapters planned, covering comprehensive Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics topics from foundational to advanced, including a multi-chapter capstone project.

**Structure Decision**: The book will be structured using Docusaurus, with each chapter residing in its own subdirectory under `docs/`. Each chapter directory will contain an `index.md` (or `.mdx`) file for the main content and a `_category_.json` for sidebar metadata. Hands-on labs will be placed in `labs/` subdirectories within relevant chapters. The capstone project content will be integrated into dedicated sections within `chapter-10-capstone-integration/capstone-parts/`. A shared `assets/` directory will centralize images and diagrams.
