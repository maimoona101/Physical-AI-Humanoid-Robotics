# Embedding Pipeline Feature

This directory contains the specification and implementation artifacts for the embedding pipeline feature that extracts text from Docusaurus URLs, generates embeddings using Cohere, and stores them in Qdrant for RAG-based retrieval.

## Directory Structure
- `spec.md` - Detailed feature specification
- `docs/` - Documentation files
- `src/` - Source code for the implementation
- `test/` - Test files
- `checklists/` - Quality checklists

## Next Steps
After reviewing the specification, proceed with:
1. `/sp.clarify` - to address any remaining questions
2. `/sp.plan` - to create an implementation plan
3. `/sp.tasks` - to generate development tasks
